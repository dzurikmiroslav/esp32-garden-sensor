# ESP32 LoRa sensor

Simple DIY low budget LoRa node. Using sensor DHT10 measure temperature and humidity. In future, I plan use GPIO pins for make some hats to add more funcionlity like measure soil mosture, PIR etc... For sensor configuration is bluetooth GATT interface.


## Hardware
Schematics and PCB can be found on [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/dzurik.miroslav/esp32-lora-sensor).
PCB is only one plate, easy for make at home conditions.
